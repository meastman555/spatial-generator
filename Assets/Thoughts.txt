Use Wang Tiles to generate a room layout (this statically works with prefabs, so now just do programatically through code)
Once a tile has been picked based on its connectivity, use grammars to determine the style of room (long, short, square, rectangle, etc), and color!
	This adds variety by having distinct generative locations (can also think of some other stuff to add if needed) and fulfills requirement of using two generative systems

Get to coding :)
